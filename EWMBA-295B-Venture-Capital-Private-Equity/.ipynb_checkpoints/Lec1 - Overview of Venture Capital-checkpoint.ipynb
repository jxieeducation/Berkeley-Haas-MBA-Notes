    "- In January 2000, everyone said that the market is going to go boom. But the valuations of companies went up by 20% in the first quarter, and 30% in the next. So we, like everyone, invested some more.\n",
    "- In the first assignment, you will talk with a VC about why they made certain decisions. No, you may not pitch your startup idea to them.
